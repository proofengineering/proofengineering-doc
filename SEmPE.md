Software Engineering meets Proof Engineering
============================================

Ideas from SE applied to maintanance of formal proofs.


Product lines of theorems and 3MT
---------------------------------

A series of works by Benjamin Delaware and co-authors building
frameworks of reusable components for building formalization of
meta-theory from STLC and its variants.

* [Product Lines of Theorems](http://people.csail.mit.edu/bendy/PLoTs/PLoTs.pdf): 
  a work exploring an idea of building a "product line" of PLs with
  different features, each requiring its own formalization.

* [Meta-Theory a la Carte](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2012/MTC.pdf):
  Similar purpose, but build around Church encodings.

* [Modular Monadic Meta-Theory](http://people.csail.mit.edu/bendy/3MT/3MT.pdf):
  Adding extendable effects using monads.


Mining proofs patterns via Machine Learning
-------------------------------------------

A series of works for identifying dulicating proofs and implementing
corresponding refactorings:

* [Machine Learning in Proof General: Interfacing Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3618)

* [Proof-Pattern Recognition and Lemma Discovery in ACL2](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~jomoa/papers/lpar2013.pdf)
