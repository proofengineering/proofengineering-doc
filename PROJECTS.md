Research projects related to proof engineering.

DeepSpec
--------

DeepSpec is an Expedition in Computing project funded by the National Science Foundation.

The DeepSpec consortium will develop new science, technology, and tools--for specifying what programs should do, for building programs that conform to those specifications, and for verifying that programs do behave exactly as specified.

REMS
----

REMS (Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream Systems), is a 6-year EPSRC-funded Programme Grant (2013-2019, Â£5.6M, Cambridge, Imperial, and Edinburgh) to explore how we can use rigorous mathematics to improve engineering practice for mainstream computer systems, to make them more robust and secure: broadly, to "create the intellectual and software tools to apply semantics and verification at the heart of mainstream system engineering".
