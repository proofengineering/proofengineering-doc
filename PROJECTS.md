Projects

Research projects related to proof engineering.

DeepSpec
--------

DeepSpec is an Expedition in Computing project funded by the National Science Foundation.

The DeepSpec consortium will develop new science, technology, and tools--for specifying what programs should do, for building programs that conform to those specifications, and for verifying that programs do behave exactly as specified.

REMS
----

REMS (Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream Systems), is a 6-year EPSRC-funded Programme Grant (2013-2019, Â£5.6M, Cambridge, Imperial, and Edinburgh) to explore how we can use rigorous mathematics to improve engineering practice for mainstream computer systems, to make them more robust and secure: broadly, to "create the intellectual and software tools to apply semantics and verification at the heart of mainstream system engineering".

Automation for Interactive Proof
--------------------------------

Funded by the EPSRC (January 2004 to January 2007).

Interactive proof tools support rich, expressive formalisms. The user can express a complex model of, say, a CPU design, and develop its formal theory. Unfortunately, interactive proof construction is tedious. At the opposite extreme, resolution systems are automatic and powerful. However, they are restricted to first-order logic with equality. Can we combine the advantages of these two technologies?

This proposal aims to combine interactive proof tools with a leading resolution theorem prover. It also abandons the traditional mode of interaction, where the proof tool does nothing until the user types a command. Background processes should try to prove the outstanding subgoals. Better automation could make formal verification affordable.
