> The QED project will be a major scientific undertaking requiring the co-operation and effort of hundreds of deep mathematical minds, considerable ingenuity by many computer scientists, and broad support and leadership from research agencies.

> [T]he following research questions would be interesting and beneficial to solve.
> 1. What are the fundamental differences and similarities between proof engineering and software engineering?
> 2. Can we estimate time and effort for a specific proof up front, and with which confidence? Related questions are: can we predict the size of the proof artefacts a project will produce? Are they related to effort? Can we predict the complexity or difficulty of a proof given artefacts that are available early in the project life cycle, such as initial specifications and/or code prototypes?
> 3. Which technical tools known from traditional software development could make an even higher impact on proof engineering? Emerging prover IDEs for instance can provide more semantic information than typical programming IDEs, and refactoring tools can be more aggressive than their code counterparts because the result is easily checked.
> 4. Are there more fundamental ways in which proof irrelevance, formal abstraction, and modularity can be exploited for the management of large scale proofs?
> 5. Can concepts such as code complexity or technical debt be transferred to proofs in a useful way?
> 6. Are there fundamental aspects of proof library design that are different to software libraries? What are the proof and specification patterns?
> 7. Empirical software engineering has identified a number of "laws" that statistically apply to the development of large software projects. Which of these continue to hold for proofs? Are there new specific correlations that hold for large scale proofs?

> For the near future I see the need for more systematic tool support to maintain the growing repositories of formalized mathematics. There is also a need to make proof assistants more accessible to more users, to allow easy browsing and editing of such libraries.

> So, what needs to be done to improve proof assistant technology and make it more widely spread? According to me, we have to work on the following.
> • Develop proof assistants further, working towards a simple basic technology that can be easily used. At this moment there are many different proof assistants. Basically, that is very good: competition leads to new ideas and improvement, by taking over and improving upon the ideas of others. Important points that need further development are: proof automatization and interfaces.
> • Develop a joint platform for the exchange of ideas and mathematical content between proof assistant system and to the ‘outside world’ of interested scientists and users of mathematics.
> • Big formalizations give feedback on the basis of those. The systems only get better if they are really used and their shortcoming are made explicit.
> • Build up a basic library, where special care has to be taken of coherence, usefulness and documentation. To which extent is the library useful for a newbie who wants to formalize a theorem using the basic mathematical results of the library?
> • Applications using the library. Can we use the proof assistant and its library when modelling and developing and verifying a new product, like a network protocol or the software operating a robot arm?
